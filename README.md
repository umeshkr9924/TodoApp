# Todo

This is a todo app made using angular framework.

## How to run on localhost.
  Requirements : Angular v10.2.2 , node.js v14.15.0 
  1. Open command prompt and go to server folder in cmd and run "node index", this will create a dummy server running on localhost:3000, using this we are getting dummy todos.
  2. Again open command prompt and go to root folder
  3. Run "ng serve -o", and open localhost:4200 in your browser.
  You will see the app running.
  4. To run unit test cases. Run "ng test" in cmd.
  

### Note : make sure to install CORS using "npm install cors --save" . This will allow todo app to hit localhost:3000 and get dummy todos.
